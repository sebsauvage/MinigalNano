MinigalNano
================

MinigalNano is a very simple image gallery. It adheres to the KISS principle and is very easy to install. MinigalNano does not have a web admin interface: You just upload your images in the photo folder on your server (using FTP, SFTP...). It only requires php and GD (no database, no special libraries like PEAR or ImageMagick).

MinigalNano uses a javascript Lightbox (Use left/right arrows for navigation), but it degrades gracefully if javascript is disabled.

MinigalNano is based on [Thomas Rybak's](http://www.minigal.dk/minigal-nano.html) version which seems to have been abandoned in 2010. It adds new themes and icons, use more modern html/css, updates JS libs, and wants to be more community pull-friendly for the future.
